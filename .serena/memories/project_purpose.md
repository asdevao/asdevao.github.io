# Project Purpose

This is a personal tech blog called "Asdevao's Tech Hub" built with Hugo static site generator. The site focuses on programming experiences, AI insights, and tech explorations. It supports both Chinese and English languages, with features like particle animations, language toggling, archive views (timeline/grid), and search functionality.

The blog uses the LoveIt theme and includes custom enhancements like sidebar language switching, animated backgrounds, and interactive elements.
